"""
Custom AST nodes for representing spliced statement blocks in the CFG.

Python's ast.Module lacks location attributes, making it unsuitable as a
wrapper for arbitrary statement slices. These nodes provide a uniform,
hashable, location-aware container for groups of consecutive statements
that form a single basic block in the control flow graph.

Subclasses distinguish the lexical context the block belongs to, allowing
the CFG and downstream analysis to differentiate module-level code from
function bodies and class bodies without inspecting the parent.
